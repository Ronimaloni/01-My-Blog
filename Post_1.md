# Let Us Begin...

## Have You Ever...

Have you ever had the sensation someone was watching you even though you are the only one in the room? Have you ever suddenly had cold chills run up your arm and down your spine? Have you ever heard phantom footsteps moving down the hall even when you know you are the only person in the building? There is no denying that most of us have had this sensation, but have you ever considered investigating the cause behind it all? That weird feeling you get in the middle of the night that if you look down that dark hallway you may see a shadow figure looming is exactly the type of thing that would make people scurry back to their beds and pull the covers over their heads. Are you the type of person that would go down that hallway anyway? There is a hobby, an unusual hobby, that you may be interested in. Ghost hunting.

Don't leave just yet. Ghost hunting is a rather serious hobby, as it can be dangerous and rewarding. There are a number of people who would pay for you to come to their property to investigate if there is actually a spiritual presence lingering. Ghost hunting is a hobby that could turn into a profession if you know the right people. The term 'ghost hunting' takes a number of forms: paranormal investigations, physical research, and pseudoscience just to name a few. 

## The History of Paranormal Investigations

Ghost hunting began as far back as the 1800s. Organizations, such as the Society for Physical Research, were formed to investigate spiritual matters. There have always been theories of spiritual beings on the earth, and those curious enough took it upon themselves to figure out if this is the case. A psychic researcher even published his work on paranormal investigations in 1936, titling it *Confessions of a Ghost-Hunter. 

Ghost hunting became popularized with television shows in the 21st century. Reality shows, like *Ghost Asylum*, and dramatic fiction shows, such as *Supernatural* on the CW, got the public interested in paranormal activity. Popularity of the subject grew quickly, and continues to grow with new people taking up the hobby and turning it into their own investigation company. 

## What is Ghost Hunting? 

Ghost hunting is the act of investigating locations that are reported to have ghosts or ghost sightings. These reports are usually only word of mouth or hear-say. People claim to have had encounters with spirits and they would like this to be confirmed. This is how ghost hunting begins. It is a serious hobby/profession that can be dangerous. Most of the time, you are investigating very rundown, desolate, and abandoned buildings, and there may be people there (dead or alive) that do not want you there. It is necessary to take the proper precautions when investigating an area for the first time. Usually, the owner of the building will call you and ask for you to come investigate. Then, the owner will tell you the history of the place and what activity has been going on there. Finally, you will be able to strategize as to what course of action will be best in your investigation. At a later date, we will go over what methods are most popular and most effective in ghost hunting. 

Research is key in any paranormal investigation. Who lived there, what did they do for a living, and how did they die? The method of death is very important as to what kind of spirit you may be dealing with. Were they brutally murdered? If so, they may be a vengeful spirit looking to destroy those who hurt them. Unfinished business is keeping that spirit on the earth instead of letting them move on. Was it a child who died of sickness? If so, they may just be playful and mess around once and a while. You may also hear that ever-frightening child laugh from the corner of the room, but that is what makes the investigation worth it.

## My History

My grandparents' farm has always been an area of slight fright for me. I get the feeling someone is watching me from the old barn or that I'm being followed, but when I turn around, no one is there. That piqued my interest as to if there really were spirits here. I became seriously interested in ghost hunting, however, around 4 years ago. It started as an obsession with a television show that I mentioned earlier - *Supernatural*. This show is a complete work of fiction, but the ghost stories in it are enthralling, and I began my own investigation on the Internet about ghost sightings in various creepy locations across the United States. Slowly, I built my arsenal for investigating for myself. As an amateur hobbyist, I do not go to asylums or abandoned jails or rundown hotels. Instead, I roam around rundown shacks and houses in my neighborhood and see if there's anything there. The experience is still an adrenaline rush, and I have found a few locations that may have had something there, but I left before I became too scared. I will admit that I do not have a high fear tolerance, so any investigation is still somewhat terrifying for me, but I'm more than willing to improve just to see what is out there.

## Why Join Us?

Ghost hunting is fun with other people interested in finding out what is truly out there. My tip is to never go alone and do your research to know what you are doing so you don't end up hurting yourself or others. Also, hunting with others gives you an excuse to have someone else hold a recording device or the flashlight while you poke your head around an abandoned building or structure. Ghost hunting can turn into a serious profession if you get in contact with the right people. It's worth investigating the field of investigating the paranormal if you like unusual hobbies or want a career doing something completely out of the ordinary.
