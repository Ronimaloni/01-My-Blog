## Topic Proposal for Blog

I decided to keep the theme of ghost hunting for this next assignment. Ghost hunting is not a normal hobby or profession, and it is an interesting world. The four posts I have in mind are:
- What ghost hunting is/isn't (intro)
- Why people get into ghost hunting and why it can be addicting
- New technology being used for ghost hunts
- My own experiences/journey with ghost hunting and adding photos and videos (media)

There is a surprising amount of articles from expert ghost hunters, and I think it's fun to write and talk about something that isn't brought up in normal conversation.
